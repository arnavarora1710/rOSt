#+description: Notes about Rust or OS things I did not know previously
#+author: Arnav Arora

* Starting with an Executable
- We want to get rid of STL because it queries the OS a lot.
  - Want an executable operating on bare metal
- Bad news: this doesn't compile (without STL...)
#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello World!

- We use the #![no_std] attribute to disable the STL.
  - As soon as we do that, we get rid of a panic handler
    - Stores and reports key information to the compiler when a panic occurs
